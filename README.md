POS for refrigerator

This project is for controlling access to a container of goods. Users with unique NFC cards can identify themselves to gain access to the container and scan the goods they have taken with a barcode scanner.

kulmik-offline.ino can be considered as the entry point.

See schematics.png to see which components are used and how they should be connected.
